Automating the installation of Redhat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) on
virtual machines (VMs) can save time, reduce human error, and ensure
consistent configurations across multiple instances. In this
Attune Project, we'll Kickstart and streamline the installation of
RHEL on VMware ESXi.

## Understanding Kickstart

Kickstart is an unattended installation method used primarily in
Red Hat-based Linux distributions like RHEL, CentOS, and Fedora. It
involves providing a predefined configuration file, often referred
to as a "Kickstart file", which contains instructions on how the
operating system should be installed. These instructions range from
language settings to disk partitioning and package selection. The
Kickstart file automates the installation process by eliminating the
need for manual intervention during setup.

## Why Kickstart with ESXi

VMware ESXi is a widely-used hypervisor that allows you to run
multiple VMs on a single physical server. Installing and configuring
each VM manually can be time-consuming and error-prone, especially
in large-scale deployments. Integrating Kickstart with ESXi brings a
higher level of efficiency and consistency to the VM provisioning
process. It ensures that RHEL installations on ESXi follow a
standardised configuration every time.
