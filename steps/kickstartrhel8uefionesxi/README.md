In this Attune Blueprint, we'll automate the process of 
provisioning a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 (RHEL 8) machine with 
UEFI boot using Kickstart on VMware ESXi. 

Automating the deployment of operating systems is a critical 
aspect of modern IT infrastructure management.

The Kickstart method is a powerful tool that allows system 
administrators to streamline the installation of Red Hat 
Enterprise Linux (RHEL) on virtual machines (VMs) running on 
VMware ESXi. 

## Understanding Kickstart Automation

Kickstart simplifies the installation of RHEL by using a 
configuration file that provides instructions for various 
installation settings. These settings range from language 
preferences to disk partitioning and package selection. By 
automating these settings, Kickstart eliminates the need for 
manual intervention during the installation process, making it a 
valuable time-saving tool.

## Importance of UEFI Boot on ESXi

VMware ESXi serves as a hypervisor that facilitates the 
virtualisation of multiple VMs on a single physical server. In 
instances where modern hardware and operating systems are 
utilised, Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) boot has 
become the standard. UEFI provides enhanced security, faster boot 
times, and compatibility with larger disks. Understanding how to 
incorporate UEFI boot into an automated installation is crucial 
for maintaining a current and efficient IT environment.
