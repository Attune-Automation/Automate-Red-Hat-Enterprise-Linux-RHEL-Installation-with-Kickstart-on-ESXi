# Automate Red Hat Enterprise Linux RHEL Installation with Kickstart on ESXi

Automating the installation of Redhat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) on
virtual machines (VMs) can save time, reduce human error, and ensure
consistent configurations across multiple instances. In this
Attune Project, we'll Kickstart and streamline the installation of
RHEL on VMware ESXi.

## Understanding Kickstart

Kickstart is an unattended installation method used primarily in
Red Hat-based Linux distributions like RHEL, CentOS, and Fedora. It
involves providing a predefined configuration file, often referred
to as a "Kickstart file", which contains instructions on how the
operating system should be installed. These instructions range from
language settings to disk partitioning and package selection. The
Kickstart file automates the installation process by eliminating the
need for manual intervention during setup.

## Why Kickstart with ESXi

VMware ESXi is a widely-used hypervisor that allows you to run
multiple VMs on a single physical server. Installing and configuring
each VM manually can be time-consuming and error-prone, especially
in large-scale deployments. Integrating Kickstart with ESXi brings a
higher level of efficiency and consistency to the VM provisioning
process. It ensures that RHEL installations on ESXi follow a
standardised configuration every time.

## Blueprints

This Project contains the following Blueprints.



### Kickstart RHEL7 BIOS on ESXi

In this Attune Blueprint, we'll automate the process of 
provisioning a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 (RHEL 7) machine with 
BIOS boot using Kickstart on VMware ESXi. 

Automating the deployment of operating systems is a critical 
aspect of modern IT infrastructure management.

The Kickstart method is a powerful tool that allows system 
administrators to streamline the installation of Red Hat 
Enterprise Linux (RHEL) on virtual machines (VMs) running on 
VMware ESXi.

* [VMWare ESXi APIs](https://github.com/Attune-Automation/VMWare-ESXi-APIs)

#### Understanding Kickstart Automation

Kickstart simplifies the installation of RHEL by using a 
configuration file that provides instructions for various 
installation settings. These settings range from language 
preferences to disk partitioning and package selection. By 
automating these settings, Kickstart eliminates the need for 
manual intervention during the installation process, making it a 
valuable time-saving tool.

#### The Need for BIOS Boot on ESXi

VMware ESXi is a hypervisor that enables the virtualisation of 
multiple guest VMs on a single physical server. In scenarios 
where BIOS boot is required instead of the more modern UEFI boot, 
the Kickstart automation process can be tailored to accommodate 
these requirements. BIOS boot is often preferred for compatibility 
with legacy systems or certain configurations.


### Kickstart RHEL7 UEFI on ESXi

In this Attune Blueprint, we'll automate the process of 
provisioning a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 (RHEL 7) machine with 
UEFI boot using Kickstart on VMware ESXi. 

Automating the deployment of operating systems is a critical 
aspect of modern IT infrastructure management.

The Kickstart method is a powerful tool that allows system 
administrators to streamline the installation of Red Hat 
Enterprise Linux (RHEL) on virtual machines (VMs) running on 
VMware ESXi.

#### Importance of UEFI Boot on ESXi

VMware ESXi serves as a hypervisor that facilitates the 
virtualisation of multiple VMs on a single physical server. In 
instances where modern hardware and operating systems are 
utilised, Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) boot has 
become the standard. UEFI provides enhanced security, faster boot 
times, and compatibility with larger disks. Understanding how to 
incorporate UEFI boot into an automated installation is crucial 
for maintaining a current and efficient IT environment.


### Kickstart RHEL8 BIOS on ESXi

In this Attune Blueprint, we'll automate the process of
